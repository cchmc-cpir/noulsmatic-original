# noulsmatic-original
Original source code for the Noulsmatic preclinical medical imaging ventilation system.

## Installation
This package doesn't really need much installation. Download and extract the contents of this repository onto the desktop or other preferred directory and then use two terminal windows (one each) to run both modules (the control panel and the monitor window) via Python 2.7:

    $ python 1_VentControl_v2a.py
    $ python 2_vitals.py
    
If the project folder is place on the **desktop**, then the included shell script (`noulsmatic_startup.sh`) can be used to execute the project.
